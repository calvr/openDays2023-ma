Notebook and data for OpenDays2023 workshop - M&amp;A

## Workshops

### Workshop 1: Estimate Wind Turbine production under a given climate

The objectives of this workshop are:

* Demonstrate how to read and process a meteorological time series so to get a climate.
* Compute a wind-turbine yield by applying its power curve to the climate.
* Expand the analysis to consider sector-wise variations of the climate.
